# README

This project was created with Create React App.

Welcome to the front-end side of Babysitting App. To view the back-end: https://github.com/A-Glazer/babysitting-app-backend. This app was created to help parents find babysitters. In this app, you can view and add new babysitters and update their schedules. 


## Usage
In the project directory, run:

### npm start
Since the backend uses `localhost:3000`, switch the port before running npm start. You can do this by typing in your terminal: `npm start --port 8000`.
